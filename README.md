# SimpleAIChatbot
A simple rule based chatbot demonstrating basic AI pattern matching concepts. My first project exploring artificial intelligence fundamentals with Python

## Overview

This chatbot uses a simple keyword based approach to respond to user inputs. 
While simple, this pattern matching system demonstrates the fundamental concept behind many AI systems: recognizing patterns in input data and responding accordingly.

## Features

- Its having Keyword based response system
- Simple natural language processing and no external libraries required

## How It Works

1. Maintains a dictionary of keywords and responses then searches for these keywords in user input
2. Responds with the appropriate pre defined answer
3. lastly Provides a default response incase when no keywords are recognized

## Usage Instructions

2. Download the "simple_chatbot.py" file
3. Run the program using the command: `python simple_chatbot.py`
4. Type messages and see the chatbot respond
